A port of the Unreal Engine Tools to OS X

All work copyright Jeremy Ernst and Epic Games and all other respective owners.
All I did was port it.


The things that won't work: 

You can't have a background image for the UI with the code that was used to construct the UI. This is due to an indexing difference between OS X Maya and Windows Maya. 

The selectionImage flag: This is windows only. This means that when you click on an button with an image, it won't 
update with another image.

If you make fixes, send a pull request.
