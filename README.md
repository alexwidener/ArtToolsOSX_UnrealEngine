# ArtToolsOSX_UnrealEngine

Unreal Engine is now free. This is as of version 4.6.x

A port of the Unreal Engine Tools to OS X

All work copyright Jeremy Ernst and Epic Games and all other respective owners.
All I did was port it.


The things that won't work: 

You can't have a background image for the UI with the code that was used to construct the UI. This is due to an indexing difference between OS X Maya and Windows Maya. 

The selectionImage flag: This is windows only. This means that when you click on an button with an image, it won't 
update with another image.

There is literally NO guarantee this will work for everyone.

If you make fixes, send a pull request.
